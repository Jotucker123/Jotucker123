- Hi, I’m @Jotucker123.
- I have 15 years of commercial leadership experience in the healthcare sector. 
- I’m interested in using healthcare data to improve patient outcomes and to drive healthcare efficiencies;
- Therefore I’ve just sucessfully passed a Data Analyst L4 Bootcamp with Cambridge Sparks, 
- and I’m pursuing options for a Masters in Data Science or Healthcare Data Science to continue this journey.
- Check out some example coding work from my portfolio involving python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, bokeh.
